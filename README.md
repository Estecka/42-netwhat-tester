# 42-netwhat-tester

The point in making this was actually to test whether I did understand the underlying maths of IP adresses. 
So I advise trying to write your own first.

### Usage
```
# Get info on a network mask with 24 bits on.
./a.out 24

# Get info on the given network mask
./a.out 255.128.0.0

#Get info on the IP 192.69.42.0/18
./a.out 18 192.69.42.0
```
